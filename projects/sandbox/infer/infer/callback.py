@dataclass
class Callback:
    """
    Callable class for handling asynchronous server
    responses for streaming inference across sequences
    of timeseries data. New sequences should be
    initialized by calling the `initialize` method before
    starting to submit requests. Only one sequence can be
    inferred upon at once.

    Once inference has completed for each sequence,
    it will be asynchronously convolved with a
    boxcar filter to perform local integration, and then
    the outputs will be clustered to find local maxima to
    identify as events.

    Args:
        id:
            Identifier used to match up sequences of
            inference requests.
        inference_sampling_rate:
            Rate at which to sample inference windows from
            the input timeseries, specified in Hz.
            Represents the sample rate of the output timeseries.
        batch_size:
            The number of subsequent windows to
            include in a single batch of inference.
        integration_window_length:
            Length of the window over which network
            outputs should be locally integrated,
            specified in seconds.
        cluster_window_length:
            Length of the window over which network
            outputs should be clustered, specified
            in seconds
        fduration:
            Length of the time-domain whitening filter,
            specified in seconds.
        psd_length:
            Length of background to use for PSD calculation,
            specified in seconds.
